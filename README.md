# What's the project about?

This is a simple project that asks the user what is their name and what is their dream vacation place. After the user gives the asked values it asks them if they want to suggest it to their friend. If they say no the program ends listing the name/names of user/users and their dream vacation place. If they input yes the program continues.

## What do I want to achieve from this?

I am a newbie in the programming world and I love to experiment. This is one of such experiments. If you have come here somehow and you are also a newbie, you are welcome to make changes and create a PR.

## Some general things that will come to your mind while reading my code:

### Why the code is so garbage?

Yeah I know it's garbage, but what do you expect from a newbie? If you think it's garbage please consider improving it so that I can learn by your more efficient code. :)

### The project is about dream vacations so why is the file named aliens.py?

There are reasons for this, first being that I want to show that things will not always be how you expect/want them to be. Learn to be facing things that are not well organised or make any sense. The second was that I was working on another project that had the name aliens.py and I forgot to change the file name while making the new file. :]
